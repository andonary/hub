## Objective

**This job has been moved to [`maven_test`](https://r2devops.io/_/r2devops-bot/maven_test).
This version is kept to avoid breaking users pipelines but it's now deprecated
and it will no longer be maintained.  Use
[`maven_test`](https://r2devops.io/_/r2devops-bot/maven_test) instead.**

Test your Java project using [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) JDK 11, JaCoCo and Surefire Maven plugins for code coverage and tests report directly in your merge requests.
