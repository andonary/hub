## Objective

This job tests your final project by using Laravel Dusk, this will run tests that you already created beforehand and stored on the folder `tests/Browser`, all the logs, console output and screenshots, if generated, will be available as an artifact when the job succeeds.


## How to use it

1. Ensure that your project has Laravel Dusk installed (see how to do that [here](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/dusk#installation){:target="_blank"})
2. Make sure your `DuskTestCase` class in `/tests/DuskTestCase.php` matches all attributes, like drive options, host url, and port, like in this example [DuskTestCase.php](https://github.com/chilio/laravel-dusk-ci/blob/master/examples/DuskTestCase.php){:target="_blank"}

    !!! warning
        There are some modifications which **you need to apply** (especially adding `--no-sandbox` in $options for driver), these changes should not affect your local dev environment, otherwise there might be something else wrong with your project.

3. Copy/paste job URL in `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` (see the [quick use](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#use-a-template)). You can specify [a fixed version](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#versioning) instead of `latest`.
4. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#job-templates-customization)
5. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€

!!! note
    All paths defined in variables are relative and starts from the root of your

## Cache

This job creates a global cache configuration. Regarding the configuration
applied, cache behavior is the following:

* Shared between all jobs and pipelines on the same branch
* Contains folder `$PROJECT_ROOT/vendor`
* If `composer install` produces different result than the cached content

More information on Gitlab caching mechanism in [Gitlab CI/CD caching
documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/caching/index.html).


## Artifact

When the job is done, it will provide an artifact containing the output from Dusk tests under these folders:

* `tests/Browser/console`
* `tests/Browser/screenshots`
* `storage/logs`

We also use Junit's XML report to display error report directly in pipeline `Tests` tab and in merge request widget. The report defined as `dusk_junit.xml` is also available directly in the artifact.
